 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0001.t: "[target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip]'s Departure"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0001.desc: "Though [target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] had been showing promise in [target.GetHerHis] training, since our separation [target.GetSheHe] has no longer been coming to my chambers for [target.GetHerHis] nightly lessons.\n\nPerhaps we will be together again one day, or perhaps I should simply find a new pet to liven up my chamber at night?"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0001.a: "I must move on"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0002.t: "Cut Tragically Short"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0002.desc: "With the death of my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('target') )] [target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip], my plans for [target.GetHerHim] no longer matter.\n\nWhatever may once have been, it is now dead."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0002.a: "Truly a pity"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1000.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1000.desc: "You summon [target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] to your chambers. Ever since [target.GetSheHe] became your [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('target') )], you've wanted to talk with [target.GetHerHim] about taking your relationship in a new direction, and you've decided there's no sense in waiting any longer. You're just not sure how [target.GetSheHe]'ll react to the idea.\n\nThe two of you talk for a long time, late into the night- about love, loyalty, and trust. About what you each want from life, and from each other. Finally, you decide that a better opportunity won't be presenting itself anytime soon.\n\nYou watch [target.GetHerHim] carefully as you you give voice to the idea that's been stirring in the back of your mind all night. What you really want is for [target.GetHerHim] to be more... obedient. More submissive. And you want to show [target.GetHerHim] how."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1000.a: "Wait for [target.GetHerHis] response"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1001.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1001.desc: "[target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] sits quite still and listens intently to every word you say. To your delight, [target.GetSheHe] seems more than amenable to your suggestion. "Of course, My [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadyLordWomanMan')|U]! Had I only known earlier that was what you wanted..." [target.GetSheHe|U] looks aside, unable to meet your gaze, and you see a slight blush on [target.GetHerHis] cheeks as [target.GetSheHe] stops [target.GetHerselfHimself] from finishing [target.GetHerHis] sentence. "In any case, I would love for you to show me how."\n\nYou suggest that the best way to show [target.GetHerHim] would be for [target.GetHerHim] to come back here a few nights a week for 'lessons.' You remind [target.GetHerHim] of your conversation earlier- as long as you both trust each other, [target.GetSheHe] has nothing to be afraid of. You brush your hand over [target.GetHerHis] cheek with approval, making [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smile- [target.GetSheHe] will learn fast, you are sure of it."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1001.a: "You couldn't have asked for this to go better"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.desc: "[target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] listens to you with a frown, and an awkward silence fills the room when you're done speaking. This was clearly not what [target.GetSheHe] had in mind for this relationship. "Are you finished?" [target.GetSheHe] eventually asks, [target.GetHerHis] tone much colder now during your earlier conversation. "I suppose I could try. If that was what you wanted though, you would probably have been better off with a different [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('target') )]."\n\nYou sigh, sorely wishing you hadn't mentioned anything at all. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] doesn't seem angry, at least- just uninterested. Nonetheless, you feel committed, and continue with your original plan, proposing that [target.GetSheHe] come back here several nights a week for 'lessons.' "As you wish, My [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadyLordWomanMan')|U]," [target.GetSheHe] responds with a hint of sarcasm in [target.GetHerHis] voice. You hope that eventually [target.GetSheHe]'ll be saying those same words in earnest, though you realize now that may take some time."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.a: "Things will improve"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.b: "Nevermind, this was a bad idea"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1003.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1003.desc: "[target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] seems a little taken aback, a mixture of confusion and concern on [target.GetHerHis] face. After a long pause, you ask whether that's something [target.GetSheHe] might be open to. "I don't know," [target.GetSheHe] responds. "But I'm willing to try, if that's really something that you want..." [target.GetSheHe|U] sounds uncertain, but when you meet [target.GetHerHis] gaze you see reassurance in [target.GetHerHis] eyes. [target.GetSheHe|U] just needs a guiding hand to figure out how [target.GetSheHe] feels about this. Specifically, your guiding hand.\n\nYou ask [target.GetHerHim] to come back here a few nights a week for 'lessons,' and remind [target.GetHerHim] of your conversation earlier- as long as you both trust each other, [target.GetSheHe] has nothing to be afraid of. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] nods, looking much more confident than [target.GetSheHe] did a few minutes ago, and departs for now. [target.GetHerHis|U] training has begun."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1003.a: "You can hardly wait"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.t: "Training Progress"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.desc: "You've been giving [target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] lessons in your chambers at night for some time now, starting off small and working your way up- instructing [target.GetHerHim] on how you want to be addressed, practicing simple directives, and, most recently, having [target.GetHerHim] dress according to your preferences. "
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.pos_response.desc: "As soon as you started, you felt the bond between you and [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] growing rapidly. [target.GetSheHe|U] tries to hide it, but you catch a smile from [target.GetHerHim] at the start of every training session- it seems [target.GetSheHe]'s starting to enjoy being told what to do, and looks extra excited when you venture into giving orders of a more sexual nature. You're not sure whether [target.GetSheHe] is just following your lead, or whether [target.GetSheHe] wanted this all along, but either way [target.GetSheHe] is quick to pick up on what you want and adapt to it."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.neg_response.desc: "[target.GetSheHe|U] is very much out of [target.GetHerHis] element during your training sessions, and is slow to adapt. It's been more of a struggle than you anticipated, but repetition and persistence are finally getting through to [target.GetHerHim]. The mild resentment at being trained has all but disappeared, and [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is finally taking a genuine interest in learning more about your desires. You can breathe a sigh of relief now- the foundations are there, and the rest of [target.GetHerHis] training should go much more smoothly."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.neutral_response.desc: "At first, it felt formal and rigid, but you've both become accustomed to it as the new normal of your relationship by now. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] now looks much more natural during [target.GetHerHis] training sessions, and has even started asking questions and making suggestions of [target.GetHerHis] own. When you dismissed [target.GetHerHim] last night, [target.GetSheHe] kissed you tenderly on the cheek and whispered a soft "Thank you" in your ear before departing."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.trait_swap.desc: "\n\[target.GetSheHe|U] has clearly made significant progress as a trainee, but there's more to it than that. Something else about [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been different lately, something deeper. You've both picked up on it- the entire way that [target.GetSheHe] carries and conducts [target.GetHerselfHimself] has been changing, slowly but surely. Some words of encouragement from you could make the changes permanent."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.a: "Encourage these changes"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.b: "No, I prefer the old [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.t: "Training Progress"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.desc: "[target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] has truly come a long way. From the moment you start speaking, [target.GetSheHe] stands a little straighter and looks more alert. When you give [target.GetHerHim] orders, you find that you barely finish saying them before [target.GetSheHe] is already moving to oblige- like part of [target.GetHerHim] wants to obey, even if [target.GetSheHe] is too embarrassed to admit it out loud yet. "
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.pos_response.desc: "From the start, you've been proud of the way [target.GetSheHe] has approached [target.GetHerHis] training. When you tell [target.GetHerHim] this, [target.GetHerHis] eyes light up and [target.GetSheHe] looks the happiest [target.GetSheHe] has all day, if not all week. "Thank you, [ROOT.Char.Custom('SubMasterMistress')|U]! You don't know how much it means to me to know that! If there is anything else I can do to make you proud of me, you need only ask." [target.GetSheHe|U] looks at you suggestively and toys with [target.GetHerHis] clothing, which you know from experience now needs only a few words from you to come off."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.neg_response.desc: "You're glad you stuck with [target.GetHerHis] training. Looking at [target.GetHerHim] now, you would never have guessed that simple, tame commands once made [target.GetHerHim] huff indignantly. At the end of today's lesson, [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks at you sheepishly, and says something that further reinforces how much things have changed. "[ROOT.Char.Custom('SubMasterMistress')|U]? There's something I've been meaning to tell you. I know it took me some time to warm up to this, but I wanted to thank you for being so patient with me. I've actually been quite enjoying your lessons lately." It may be a small gesture, but coming from [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], it feels meaningful."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.trait_swap.desc: "\n\nYou can see that [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been taking [target.GetHerHis] training to heart. You could probably set some behavioral rules for [target.GetHerHim], now that [target.GetSheHe] is more receptive to surrendering control to you. You also once again have an opportunity to encourage a dramatic shift in [target.GetHerHis] personality that you've noticed recently, and make it part of the fiber of [target.GetHerHim] being from now on."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.a: "Encourage these changes"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.b: "No, I prefer the old [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.t: "Training Progress"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.desc: "Your nightly obedience lessons with [target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip], once closer to a chore than recreation, have quickly become the best part of your day. In fact, all the time you spend with [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been wonderful lately! In a thousand subtle ways, [target.GetSheHe] has become more attentive to your needs and wants than ever before, and has been doing [target.GetHerHis] best to accommodate them. You've even let [target.GetHerHim] lead some of the lessons [target.GetHerselfHimself], and found that [target.GetSheHe] had some excellent suggestions you'd never even thought of!\n\nOf course, not all of the improvements have been quite so subtle. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has also become a most generous lover, and now smiles and thrusts [target.GetHerHis] chest out invitingly when you casually grope [target.GetHerHis] breasts, telling you in no uncertain terms that you are more than welcome to cop a feel a little lower down if you want. And that's to say nothing of [target.GetHerHis] generosity in the bedroom."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.trait_swap.desc: "\n\n[target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s training is nearly complete now- there are just a few more things left to do before you're ready to bring it to a close. Meanwhile, [target.GetSheHe] has continued adjusting to a more docile mindset. It seems you have one final chance to effect a change to [target.GetHerHis] core personality, if you so desire."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.a: "Encourage these changes"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.b: "No, I prefer the old [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.2000.t: "Training Complete"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.2000.desc: "You summon [target.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] to your chambers, thinking back to when you gave the same order the night [target.GetHerHis] training first began. It's evident from the moment [target.GetSheHe] steps into the room, though, that the woman who arrives tonight is very different from the one who you started to train so many months ago. As soon as [target.GetSheHe] enters, [target.GetSheHe] pulls [target.GetHerHis] robe off of [target.GetHerHis] shoulders and lets it fall to the floor with a dull thump. [target.GetSheHe|U] is naked underneath- [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is almost always naked, or wearing risque clothing of your choice, when the two of you are alone together. Hips swaying gracefully as [target.GetSheHe] walks, [target.GetSheHe] comes over to you and stands, ready to serve. You can see in [target.GetHerHis] eyes that [target.GetSheHe] is hungry for your affection, but [target.GetSheHe] waits for you to make the first move. "You summoned me, [ROOT.Char.Custom('SubMasterMistress')|U]?" [target.GetSheHe] asks dutifully.\n\nYou tell [target.GetHerHim] that tonight, you are at long last ready to call [target.GetHerHis] training complete. All that you need is one last acknowledgement from [target.GetHerHim]- is [target.GetSheHe] sure this is what [target.GetSheHe] really wants? [target.GetSheHe|U] responds without budging or having to think about it- the answer has been thoroughly burned into [target.GetHerHim] now. "More than anything, [ROOT.Char.Custom('SubMasterMistress')|U]. I surrender myself to you completely. I am yours, and yours alone.""
