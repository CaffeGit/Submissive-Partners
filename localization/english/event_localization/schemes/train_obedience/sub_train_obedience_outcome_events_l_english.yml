 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0001.t: "[target.GetTitledFirstName]'s Departure"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0001.desc: "Though [target.GetTitledFirstName] had been showing promise in her training, since our separation she has no longer been coming to my chambers for her nightly lessons.\n\nPerhaps we will be together again one day, or perhaps I should simply find a new pet to liven up my chamber at night?"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0001.a: "I must move on"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0002.t: "Cut Tragically Short"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0002.desc: "With the death of my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('target') )] [target.GetTitledFirstName], my plans for her no longer matter.\n\nWhatever may once have been, it is now dead."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.0002.a: "Truly a Pity"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1000.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1000.desc: "You summon [target.GetTitledFirstName] to your chambers. Ever since she became your [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('target') )], you've wanted to talk with her about taking your relationship in a new direction, and you've decided there's no sense in waiting any longer. You're just not sure how she'll react to the idea.\n\nThe two of you talk for a long time, late into the night- about love, loyalty, and trust. About what you each want from life, and from each other. Finally, you decide that a better opportunity won't be presenting itself anytime soon.\n\nYou watch her carefully as you you give voice to the idea that's been stirring in the back of your mind all night. What you really want is for her to be more... obedient. More submissive. And you want to show her how."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1000.a: "Wait for her response"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1001.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1001.desc: "[target.GetTitledFirstName] sits quite still and listens intently to every word you say. To your delight, she seems more than amenable to your suggestion. "Of course, My [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadyLordWomanMan')|U]! Had I only known earlier that was what you wanted..." She looks aside, unable to meet your gaze, and you see a slight blush on her cheeks as she stops herself from finishing her sentence. "In any case, I would love for you to show me how.\"\n\nYou suggest that the best way to show her would be for her to come back here a few nights a week for 'lessons.' You remind her of your conversation earlier- as long as you both trust each other, she has nothing to be afraid of. You brush your hand over her cheek with approval, making [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smile- she will learn fast, you are sure of it."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1001.a: "You couldn't have asked for this to go better"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.desc: "[target.GetTitledFirstName] listens to you with a frown, and an awkward silence fills the room when you're done speaking. This was clearly not what she had in mind for this relationship. "Are you finished?" she eventually asks, her tone much colder now during your earlier conversation. "I suppose I could try. If that was what you wanted though, you would probably have been better off with a different [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('target') )]."\n\nYou sigh, sorely wishing you hadn't mentioned anything at all. [target.GetTitledFirstName] doesn't seem angry, at least- just uninterested. Nonetheless, you feel committed, and continue with your original plan, proposing that she come back here several nights a week for 'lessons.' "As you wish, My [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadyLordWomanMan')|U]," she responds with a hint of sarcasm in her voice. You hope that eventually she'll be saying those same words in earnest, though you realize now that may take some time."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.a: "Things will improve"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1002.b: "Nevermind, this was a bad idea"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1003.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1003.desc: "[target.GetTitledFirstName] seems a little taken aback, a mixture of confusion and concern on her face. After a long pause, you ask whether that's something she might be open to. "I don't know," she responds. "But I'm willing to try, if that's really something that you want..." She sounds uncertain, but when you meet her gaze you see reassurance in her eyes. She just needs a guiding hand to figure out how she feels about this. Specifically, your guiding hand.\n\nYou ask her to come back here a few nights a week for 'lessons,' and remind her of your conversation earlier- as long as you both trust each other, she has nothing to be afraid of. [target.GetShortUIName|U] nods, looking much more confident than she did a few minutes ago, and departs for now. Her training has begun."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1003.a: "You can hardly wait"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.t: "Training Progress"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.desc: "You've been giving [target.GetTitledFirstName] lessons in your chambers at night for some time now, starting off small and working your way up- instructing her on how you want to be addressed, practicing simple directives, and, most recently, having her dress according to your preferences. "
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.pos_response.desc: "As soon as you started, you felt the bond between you and [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] growing rapidly. She tries to hide it, but you catch a smile from her at the start of every training session- it seems she's starting to enjoy being told what to do, and looks extra excited when you venture into giving orders of a more sexual nature. You're not sure whether she is just following your lead, or whether she wanted this all along, but either way she is quick to pick up on what you want and adapt to it."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.neg_response.desc: "She is very much out of her element during your training sessions, and is slow to adapt. It's been more of a struggle than you anticipated, but repetition and persistence are finally getting through to her. The mild resentment at being trained has all but disappeared, and [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is finally taking a genuine interest in learning more about your desires. You can breathe a sigh of relief now- the foundations are there, and the rest of her training should go much more smoothly."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.neutral_response.desc: "At first, it felt formal and rigid, but you've both become accustomed to it as the new normal of your relationship by now. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] now looks much more natural during her training sessions, and has even started asking questions and making suggestions of her own. When you dismissed her last night, she kissed you tenderly on the cheek and whispered a soft "Thank you" in your ear before departing."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.trait_swap.desc: "\n\nShe has clearly made significant progress as a trainee, but there's more to it than that. Something else about [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been different lately, something deeper. You've both picked up on it- the entire way that she carries and conducts herself has been changing, slowly but surely. Some words of encouragement from you could make the changes permanent."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.a: "Encourage these changes"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1500.b: "No, I prefer the old [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.t: "Training Progress"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.desc: "[target.GetTitledFirstName] has truly come a long way. From the moment you start speaking, she stands a little straighter and looks more alert. When you give her orders, you find that you barely finish saying them before she is already moving to oblige- like part of her wants to obey, even if she is too embarrassed to admit it out loud yet. "
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.pos_response.desc: "From the start, you've been proud of the way she has approached her training. When you tell her this, her eyes light up and she looks the happiest she has all day, if not all week. "Thank you, My [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadyLordWomanMan')|U]! You don't know how much it means to me to know that! If there is anything else I can do to make you proud of me, you need only ask." She looks at you suggestively and toys with her clothing, which you know from experience now needs only a few words from you to come off."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.neg_response.desc: "You're glad you stuck with her training. Looking at her now, you would never have guessed that simple, tame commands once made her huff indignantly. At the end of today's lesson, [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks at you sheepishly, and says something that further reinforces how much things have changed. "My [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadyLordWomanMan')|U]? There's something I've been meaning to tell you. I know it took me some time to warm up to this, but I wanted to thank you for being so patient with me. I've actually been quite enjoying your lessons lately." It may be a small gesture, but coming from [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], it feels meaningful."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.trait_swap.desc: "\n\nYou can see that [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been taking her training to heart. You could probably set some behavioral rules for her, now that she is more receptive to surrendering control to you. You also once again have an opportunity to encourage a dramatic shift in her personality that you've noticed recently, and make it part of the fiber of her being from now on."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.a: "Encourage these changes"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.b: "No, I prefer the old [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.t: "Training Progress"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.desc: "Your nightly obedience lessons with [target.GetTitledFirstName], once closer to a chore than recreation, have quickly become the best part of your day. In fact, all the time you spend with [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been wonderful lately! In a thousand subtle ways, she has become more attentive to your needs and wants than ever before, and has been doing her best to accommodate them. You've even let her lead some of the lessons herself, and found that she had some excellent suggestions you'd never even thought of!\n\nOf course, not all of the improvements have been quite so subtle. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has also become a most generous lover, and now smiles and thrusts her chest out invitingly when you casually grope her breasts, telling you in no uncertain terms that you are more than welcome to cop a feel a little lower down if you want. And that's to say nothing of her generosity in the bedroom."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1501.trait_swap.desc: "\n\n[target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s training is nearly complete now- there are just a few more things left to do before you're ready to bring it to a close. Meanwhile, she has continued adjusting to a more docile mindset. It seems you have one final chance to effect a change to her core personality, if you so desire."
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.a: "Encourage these changes"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.1502.b: "No, I prefer the old [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 sub_train_obedience_outcome.2000.t: "Training Complete"
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.2000.desc: "You summon [target.GetTitledFirstName] to your chambers, thinking back to when you gave the same order the night her training first began. It's evident from the moment she steps into the room, though, that the woman who arrives tonight is very different from the one who you started to train so many months ago. As soon as she enters, she pulls her robe off of her shoulders and lets it fall to the floor with a dull thump. She is naked underneath- [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is almost always naked, or wearing risque clothing of your choice, when the two of you are alone together. Hips swaying gracefully as she walks, she comes over to you and stands, ready to serve. You can see in her eyes that she is hungry for your affection, but she waits for you to make the first move. "You summoned me, Master?" she asks dutifully.\n\nYou tell her that tonight, you are at long last ready to call her training complete. All that you need is one last acknowledgement from her- is she sure this is what she really wants? She responds without budging or having to think about it- the answer has been thoroughly burned into her now. "Yes, Master. I surrender myself to you completely. I am yours, and yours alone.""
 sub_train_obedience_outcome.2000.a: "The perfect answer"
