 game_concept_sub_train_obedience_scheme_desc: "The $game_concept_sub_train_obedience_scheme$ is a [personal_scheme|E] to train a character to be [sub_subservient_concept|E].\n\nWhile eventual success is assured, low opinion or a willful personality can make it a long process. However, the rewards last a lifetime and are well worth the effort."

 game_concept_sub_subservient_concept: "Subservient"
 game_concept_sub_subservience_concept_desc: "$game_concept_sub_subservience_concept$ has many facets, and is taught through the [sub_train_obedience_scheme|E]. Characters who are $game_concept_sub_subservient_concept$ to a Master or Mistress tend to have an extremely high opinion of that character, strive to please them, and are open to following rules set by them.\n\nBeing $game_concept_sub_subservient_concept$ to someone is separate from being their [submissive|E]. Completing an $game_concept_sub_train_obedience_scheme$ will always make the trainee $game_concept_sub_subservient_concept$, but becoming a $game_concept_submissive$ requires mutual gender attraction."
